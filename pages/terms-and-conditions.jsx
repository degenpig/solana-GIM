<h2><strong>Linking Your Digital Wallet</strong></h2>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
You do not have to create an account in order to use or access the Platform.  However, in order to access certain Services, including purchasing Gimmicks NFTs as described below, you will need to link a digital wallet that is compatible with the Solana blockchain and is owned by you to our Services.   We do not own or control any of the digital wallets that we may support, and our support of a specific digital wallet, or a description of how to obtain or use one, should not be interpreted as our endorsement or guarantee of the functionality of that digital wallet.  Your use of the digital wallet you choose to use is at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of that digital wallet.  You can find information regarding how to connect your digital wallet to our Services here: https://www.therealgimmicks.com/#faq.
  </li>
  <li>
You are responsible for all uses of your digital wallet and for any actions that take place using your digital wallet, whether by you or by another person.  You are solely responsible for keeping your digital wallet private key confidential and secure.
  </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>
Gimmicks NFTs
</strong> </h2>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
You may obtain a non-fungible token (“NFT”) through our Platform that links to and identifies a unique Gimmicks digital artwork (each such artwork, a “Gimmick,” and each such NFT, a “Gimmicks NFT”). A Gimmicks NFT identifies the Gimmick with which it is associated through a pointer or hash in the Gimmicks NFT metadata.  We will not mint multiple NFTs of the specific Gimmick digital artwork you obtained from us, but we may mint NFTs of different variations of your Gimmick digital artwork (e.g., different poses or characteristics).
  </li>
  <li>
Owners of a Gimmicks NFT have certain rights and benefits as described in further detail in Section 6.
  </li>
  <li>
The Gimmicks NFTs are minted through a smart contract on the Solana blockchain. A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger of transactions maintained by a distributed peer-to-peer computer network that cryptographically validates transactions and records such transactions on the ledger.  Gimmicks NFTs are recorded on the Solana blockchain, and we use smart contracts to allow you to send and receive Gimmicks NFTs.  You acknowledge and agree that certain information, including your digital wallet address and the transactions you conduct through that digital wallet address, may be publicly available and viewable on the Solana blockchain.  Your Gimmicks NFT can be transferred on the Solana blockchain (or another blockchain as technology permits) from one digital wallet address to another digital wallet address.
  </li>
  <li>
Each Gimmicks NFT will include metadata with information about that specific Gimmicks NFT, including, but not limited to, title, description, image URL, and any attributes we might include.
  </li>
</ol>
</li><li>
<h2><strong>
Obtaining Your Gimmicks NFT
</strong> </h2>
<ol type="a">
    <li>
All Gimmicks NFTs offered on our Platform will be made available at no cost or charge except for the payment of the Solana Gas Fees described below.  At selected times determined by us, we will make a certain number of Gimmicks NFTs available to a category of individuals, such as individuals who attended a specific event.  If you are in that category, you will be informed how you can submit your Solana wallet address to be eligible for a free Gimmicks NFT.  You may also be asked to verify your eligibility in that category, such as establishing that you attended the event.  We will make Gimmicks NFTs available to be minted to those who are eligible in a category on a first-come, first-served basis.  Our decision on who has the right to mint a Gimmicks NFT is final.
    </li>
    <li>
We may also announce that we will make Gimmicks NFTs available to the general public on first-come, first-served basis based on who provided us with a valid Solana digital wallet address first.  Our decisions on who has the right to mint a Gimmicks NFT is final.
  </li>
  <li>
Once you are told you have the right to mint a Gimmicks NFT under Sections 3(a) or 3(b), you will also be given a deadline by when you have to mint your Gimmicks NFT.  If you do not mint your Gimmick NFT by the end of that deadline, you will lose your right to mint a Gimmicks NFT.
  </li>
  <li>
To mint your free Gimmicks NFT, you are required to have a minimum amount of SOL cryptocurrency in your digital wallet to cover the transaction fee (also known as a “Gas Fee”) imposed by the Solana blockchain.  Gas Fees are paid to the network of computers that operate the Solana blockchain and are not paid to Gimmicks.  Note that Gas Fees often fluctuate based on a number of factors.  If you attempt to mint your Gimmicks NFT and do not have sufficient SOL to cover the gas fees, the transaction may fail and you may be required to complete the process again.
  </li>
  <li>
Each Gimmick is unique and you acknowledge and agree that when you obtain a Gimmicks NFT on the Platform you will not know which Gimmick will be associated with that NFT.  Gimmicks NFTs are minted directly into the digital wallet you have connected to our Service and through which you made your Gas Fee payment.  We never hold custody nor take ownership or possession of a Gimmicks NFT.
  </li>
</ol>
</li><li>
<h2><strong>
Secondary Marketplaces and Third-Party Sites
</strong> </h2>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
You are permitted to sell, trade, or distribute your Gimmicks NFT on any smart contract enabled secondary marketplaces, platforms and exchanges operated by third parties where users can sell, purchase, transfer, list for auction and bid on NFTs (“Secondary Marketplaces”).  Note that Gimmicks NFTs may not be compatible with all Secondary Marketplaces, and we make no guarantee about the availability or functionality of any Secondary Marketplace.  If you seek to transfer your Gimmicks NFT via a Secondary Marketplace you may also incur additional Gas Fees or other transaction costs.
  </li>
  <li>
These Terms only relate to your use of the Services, and do not relate to any other website or Internet-based services, including Secondary Marketplaces or other websites or browser extensions to which the Services may link (“Third-Party Sites”).  References or links to any Third-Party Site are provided for your convenience and information only, for example, to make it convenient for you to trade your Gimmicks NFT.  Such links should not be interpreted as our endorsement of any Third-Party Site.  When you click such link, we may not warn you that you have left our Services and are subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of a Third-Party Site.  We are not responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with your use of or reliance on any content, advertising, products, services, information or other materials on Third-Party Sites.
  </li>
  <li>
You acknowledge and agree that we are not a party to any agreement or transaction where you trade on any Secondary Marketplace a Gimmicks NFT which was initially obtained via our Service, whether or not we receive a commission or fee as a consequence of the transaction.  We are not liable for any loss incurred by you in connection with any transaction that takes place on Secondary Marketplaces or on any other Third-Party Sites or services.
  </li>
  <li>
We may provide experiences on social media platforms that enable online sharing and collaboration among users who have registered to use them.  Any content you post is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those platforms and related services.  We have no control over such social media platforms or related services.
  </li>
</ol>
</li><li>
<h2><strong>
Taxes
</strong> </h2>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
You are solely responsible for determining and paying (or reimbursing for the payment of) any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (excluding taxes imposed on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any tax or other governmental authority associated with your use of the Platform (collectively, the “Taxes”).  You will pay or reimburse us for all Taxes of any jurisdiction (whether national, federal, state, local, foreign or other), including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, federal, state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction; and will not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such Taxes or amounts levied in lieu thereof from payments (including Gas Fees) made to us pursuant to these Terms.

  </li>
  <li>
You are hereby granted a limited license (without the right to sublicense) to access and use the Content solely for your personal, non-commercial use, provided that you keep all copyright or other proprietary notices intact.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are also granted a limited license (without the right to sublicense) to copy, access, use and otherwise exploit the graphical image of your Gimmick for commercial purposes, which shall include the right to produce and sell tangible merchandise (such as t-shirts, hats, and mugs) as well as digital goods (collectively, “User Goods”), subject to the following conditions: (i) you may not alter any characteristic of the graphical image of your Gimmick, meaning you cannot modify or embellish any feature (e.g., if your Gimmick is wearing a blue collar, you may not make it red), but you are permitted to alter the pose of your Gimmick (e.g., if your Gimmick is standing, you may alter the graphical image such that your Gimmick is sitting down), so long as such alteration does not impair or tarnish the quality of the graphical image; (ii) you do not have any right to mint any NFTs linked to or associated with your Gimmick; (iii) you may not use the name “Gimmick” or any Gimmick logo, the character name of your Gimmick, the name of any other Gimmick characters, or any animation, characters, plots, themes or other material related to the Animated Series; (iv) you do not have any right to create any digital animation or animated video or graphic that includes your Gimmick or any right to use your Gimmick in connection with any gaming service or application (including NFT-based card games); and (v) you may not combine your Gimmick with any Gimmick you do not own, unless you have the explicit permission of that Gimmick owner.  The foregoing license applies only during the period that you own the Gimmick NFT associated with your Gimmick.  Your license terminates immediately at such point that you no longer own your Gimmick NFT. You acknowledge and agree that you are fully liable and responsible for any User Goods, and that Gimmicks shall have no liability or responsibility in connection therewith whatsoever, other than claims that the Gimmicks NFT in the form licensed to you infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party.
  </li>
  <li>
Nothing in these Terms shall be interpreted as granting any license of intellectual property rights to you other than as explicitly set forth in these Terms.
  </li>
  <li>
For each Gimmicks NFT you obtain from us or from a Secondary Marketplace, you have full ownership rights in the Gimmicks NFT, including the right to store, sell and transfer your NFT.  However, you acknowledge and agree that your Gimmicks NFT does not provide you any rights, express or implied, in (including, without limitation, any copyrights or other intellectual property rights in or to) the Gimmick associated with the NFT other than a limited license to use, copy, view, and display such Gimmick and exploit such Gimmick pursuant to Section 7(b), and a limited license to view and display any associated Animated Series, for your own personal, non-commercial use and in connection with a proposed sale or transfer of the Gimmicks NFT.  You do not have the right to distribute, or otherwise commercialize your Gimmick or any Animated Series other than as set forth herein without our explicit prior written authorization. This means, for example, that you cannot post any Animated Series on any platform or service where it will be accessible by others. Your rights and interest in your Gimmicks NFT and its associated Gimmick, including the rights and benefits set forth in Section 6, will immediately terminate upon any subsequent sale, transfer, dispossession, burning, or other relinquishment of your Gimmicks NFT.

If you have any questions regarding these risks, please contact us at the email address provided at the end of these Terms.

You acknowledge that you have a sufficient understanding of the functionality, usage, storage, transmission mechanisms and other material characteristics of, blockchain technology, NFTs, digital assets, digital wallets, and cryptocurrencies to understand these Terms and to appreciate the risks and implications of purchasing a Gimmicks NFT.
</li><li>
You acknowledge that we do not provide any application or other service to receive, access, view, or display your Gimmick or any Animated Series, and do not guarantee you will be able to do so.  It is your responsibility to procure a digital wallet or other means to allow for you to access or view your Gimmick and the Animated Series, and to store the requisite private key(s) or other credentials necessary to access your digital wallet or other technologies.  You acknowledge that the risk of acquiring a Gimmicks NFT from us; holding and using the Gimmicks NFT; and transferring your Gimmicks NFT to others rests entirely with you.  If your private key(s) or other access credentials are lost, you may lose access to your Gimmicks NFT.  We are not responsible for any such losses, including, but not limited to, losses arising from third-party service providers.
</li><li>
You acknowledge and represent that there is substantial uncertainty as to the characterization of NFTs and other digital assets under applicable law. You acknowledge that you are complying with all applicable laws and regulation in your jurisdiction in connection with obtaining a Gimmicks NFT from us.
</li><li>
We are not responsible if your Gimmick or any Animated Series becomes inaccessible to you for any reason, or for any modifications or changes to your Gimmick or any Animated Series, including any deletion, removal, or inaccessibility on our Platform or otherwise.  Further you acknowledge and agree that we may use decentralized storage systems to store the Animated Series, and we are not responsible for any risks that may be presented by such storage systems. You acknowledge that the Gimmick graphical image can be copied and distributed and that we cannot guarantee that additional copies of the Gimmick associated with your Gimmicks NFT will not be created by others. You also acknowledge and agree that we or any third party on our behalf could make additional copies of, and distribute, the Gimmick associated with your Gimmicks NFT, and could sell or otherwise assign the copyright or other intellectual property rights or economic rights in such Gimmick.
</li><li>
</li><li>
You also acknowledge and agree that:
<ol type="i"><li>
We are making the Gimmicks NFTs available for free (other than Gas Fees that may apply).  If you elect to sell your Gimmicks NFT, or purchase one on a Secondary Marketplace, you do so at your own risk, and we have no liability in connection with such sale nor the price at which you decide to sell or purchase a Gimmicks NFT.
</li><li>
Our Services do not store, send, or receive Gimmicks NFTs. Your Gimmicks NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Solana blockchain. Any transfer of Gimmicks NFTs occurs within the Solana blockchain and not on the Service or Platform.
</li><li>
There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your digital wallet.
</li><li>
The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Platform or Services, and therefore the potential utility or value of your Gimmicks NFTs.
</li><li>
Upgrades to the Solana blockchain, a hard fork in the Solana blockchain, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Solana blockchain may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the Solana blockchain’s NFT standard, including the Platform.
